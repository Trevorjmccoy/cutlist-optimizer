Welcome to the Moulding/Trim Linear Cut List Calculator, your go-to tool for optimizing material cuts and minimizing waste!

This 1D cutlist calculator is specially designed for cutting crown moulding.

In addition to length and quantity, it uses the depth of your chosen moulding in conjunction with the angles of surrounding wall corners to pinpoint the minimum amount of material needed to complete the job, reducing both material cost and waste.

Optimized cutlists can be converted to PDF to be printed, shared, etc.

I hope you enjoy!
